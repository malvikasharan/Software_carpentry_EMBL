#Python session - 1

##Aim of this session: 

Learn the basics (what is? how to?)

###Classic beginning with "Hello World!"

- Open your terminal
- Run Python (Type ‘python’ + Enter-key)
- Print something on terminal
  - print(“Hello World!”)
- Type quit() + Enter-key to quit

###Literal Constants

We use the values of literals literally, these values represent themselves and nothing else.

- int(): Integers or whole numbers of any length like 2, 30, 1000
- float(): Floats or floating point numbers like 1.9, 30.01, 1e3 
- str(): String or sequence of characters like “Hello”,  “1 World”, “&”
  - Single quote and double quotes
    - Either of the quote can be used to print a string
    - Spaces, tabs, comma etc. inside the quotes are preserved
  - Triple Quotes
    - Multi line strings can be specified by triple quotes (‘’’ or “””)

##Excercise - 1

- Print more strings
- Print numbers 
- Hint: does not need quotes
- Print a float with int() and integer with float() types
- Print multiple strings and numbers together
  - Hint 1: use comma as separator
  - Hint 2: use plus sign (+) to connect 
    - gives error (or sum, when int1+int2) with numbers, how to solve this?
- Print a string with double quote
  - Example: “this string appears with double quotes”

###Variables

- Using literal constants will become boring
  - What does Python do if you write everything on my own?
- Variables are the instances for which different values can be assigned
  - Allow storing of information in your computer’s memory
- We need a method to access them by giving them names (Identifiers)

####Rules:
- The identifiers are case sensitive 
  - myname and MyName are different
- The name starts with a letter or alphabet
- Followed by letters, underscores or digits (name_1)

###String formatter

The string format operators allows formatting output of an ordered strings

  - Previous example: print “Age of”, name, “is”, age
  - Pythonic way 1: print “Age of {} is {}”.format(name, age)
  - Pythonic way 2: print “Age of %s is %s” % (name, age)
    - There are several options with %:
    - %s: string
    - %d: decimal point number
    - %f: float point number
    - %.2f: float point number to 2 decimal places

##Excercise - 2

- Assign any value to variable i, print and check the value
  - Example: i = 10
- Reassign a different value to i, print and check
  - Example: i = 23
  - You just overwrote the value of i, the last assigned value is the current value
- Assign multiple variables same values, print and check
  - Example: a = b = c = 59
- Assign multiple variables (a, b, c) different values, print and check
  - In separate lines (a = 1 + Enter-key, b = 2 + Enter-key, c = 3 + Enter-key)
  - In the same line (a, b, c = 1, 2, 3)

###Opertaors and operands

- Operators are functionality that do something and can be represented by the symbols such as + or special keywords
- Operators operate on data referred as operands
- Examples 
  - 4 + 6
  - 5 * 8
  - 'a' + 'b'
- Here the numbers and letters are operands and the symbols (+,* ...) are operators

##Exercise - 3

Assign numerical values to X and Y and do the following

1. Sum x and y by plus: x + y
2. Subtract y from x by minus: x - y
3. Multiply x and y: x * y
4. Multiply a string with y: ‘X’ * y
5. Return x to the power of y: x**y
6. Divide x by y: x/y
7. Return remainder of x divided by y: x % y
8. Check if x is greater than y: x > y
9. Check if x is smaller than y: x < y
10. Check if x is less than or equal to 100: x <= 100
11. Check if y is greater than or equal to 5: y >= 100
12. Check if x is equal to y: x == y
13. Check if x is not equal to y: x != y

###Math operators and operands

We can use multiple operators together
- Evaluation order is what high school taught us: BODMAS

- B: Brackets first
- O: Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)
- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

- Division before multiplication and addition before subtraction
- However the order can be altered by using brackets
  - Example: 4/2*3+1-5 = 2 but 4/2*(3+1-5) = -2
  - Use multiple operators (example: x+y*y/x)

- Operands can be over-written
  - Solution – 1
    - Assign a value to variable a
    - Reassign/overwrite value of a as a * 3
      - a = 2
      - a = a * 3
      - a
  - Solution – 1
    - Assign a value to variable a
    - Reassign/overwrite value of a as a * 3
      - a = 2
      - a *= 3
      - a

###Data structure - 1

- Data Structures are containers that hold/store a collection of data/object together 
- There are two built-in data structures that we will discuss here
  - List (list): holds ordered collection of objects separated by comma
    - Objects are present in the given order any change in introduced
    - Lists are mutable: data can be added and removed
    - An empty list are created as: my_list = []
    - A list with values are created as: my_list = [1, 2, ‘a’, ‘b’]

##Exercise - 4

- print and check at each step
- help(list)

1. create a list with five items and follow the exercise (hint: my_list = [1, 2, ‘C’, 4, ‘E’]) 
2. Add/append an item: my_list.append(‘X’)
3. Access the list item by index, which are the position of items (counted from 0)
  - Access the 1st item: my_list[0] (square brackets to define the index)
  - Access the last item: my_list[-1]
  - Access the 4th item (?)
  - Access items from position 2 to 4: my_list[1:4] 
    - Here 4 means item in the 5th position, last mentioned index is not accessed
  - Access items at the index 2 to the second last position (?)
  - Access items from the beginning to the position 4: mylist[:4]
  - Access items at the index 2 to the last position (?)
4. Insert an item in the 4th position: my_list.insert(3, ‘X’)
5. Check the items in the list and find the number of items: len(my_list)
6. Remove ‘X’ from the list: my_list.remove(‘X’)
  - Check the length again
5. Remove an item from a position from any index (i=3): my_list.pop([i])
8. Get maximum value in the list: max(my_list)
9. Get minimum value in the list: min(my_list)
  - Letters are considered larger than digits
10. Reverse items in the list: my_list.reverse()
11. Sort items of the list: sorted(my_list)
  - Reverse the items again
12. Summed up the value of a list containing all the numerical items: sum(list_num)
  - Hint: list_num = [1, 2, 3, 4]
13. Convert a string into list: list(my_string)
  - Hints: string = ‘convert string into list’
14. Count the occurrence of an item
  - hint-1: list(‘convert string into list’).count(‘t’)
  - hint-2: new_list = list(‘convert string into list’)
            new_list.count(‘t’)
15. Convert a string into list by splitting it by space: my_string.split(‘  ’)
  - Try splitting by different lists by different characters
16. Get unique items of the list: set(new_list)
  - Note: Set is another data structute, with an unordered collection without duplicates Created as: my_set = set()
17. Dealing with two lists: define 2 lists with some items (list1 and list2)
  - Create a third list as list3: list3 = list1 + list2
  - Extend list1 by list2: list1.extend(list2)
  - Create a list with only unique items from the lists: set(list1).union(list2)
  - Find common items in the lists: set(list1).intersection(list2)

###Data structure - 2

- Dictionary (dict): a list of key-value pairs where key can be any numbers or strings and values can be any arbitrary python object
  - An empty dict is created as: my_dict = {} or my_dict()
  - Key and value are separated by a colon (:)
  - A list with key-value pairs are created as: my_dict = {‘Key_1’: ‘Val_1’}
  
##Excercise - 5

1. Create a dictionary with key-value pairs: my_dict = {‘name’ : ‘Khaleesi’, ‘age’ : 20}
2. Access value by a key: my_dict[‘name’] or my_dict.get(‘name’)
3. Add more items to the dictionary: my_dict[‘occupation’] = ‘Queen’
4. Print all the items: my_dict
4. Print all the key-value pairs as list: my_dict.items()
5. Print all the keys of the dictionary as list: my_dict.keys()
6. Print all the values of the dictionary as list: my_dict.values()
7. Remove a key-value pair: my_dict.pop(‘age’)
8. Remove the last key-value pair: my_dict.popitem()
9. Check if a key is in the dict: ‘location’ in my_dict and ‘age’ in my_dict
10. Remove all the items from the dict: my_dict.clear()
