#Python session - 1

##Aim of this session: 
1. To learn the basics (what is? how to?)
2. How to read, write, manipulate and process information?
3. How to get repeated tasks done without repeated coding?
4. How to deal with scientific data using Python?

###Classic beginning with "Hello World!"

1.  Open your terminal
2. Run Python (Type ‘python’ + Enter-key)
  1. print(“Hello World!”)
3. Type quit() + Enter-key to quit

###Literal Constants

We use the values of literals literally

These values represent themselves and nothing else

1. int(): Integers or whole numbers of any length like 2, 30, 1000
2. float(): Floats or floating point numbers like 1.9, 30.01, 1e3 
3. str(): String or sequence of characters like “Hello”,  “1 World”, “&”
  1. Single quote and double quotes
    1. Either of the quote can be used to print a string
    2. Spaces, tabs, comma etc. inside the quotes are preserved
  2. Triple Quotes
    1. Multi line strings can be specified by triple quotes (‘’’ or “””)
