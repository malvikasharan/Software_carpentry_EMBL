Python functions:

Python functions are organised block of code called to run any time in your scripts. Instead of pasting the codes in all the places you need it, you can call a function and carry out the task.

If you write a code of above 30 lines, your code will become convoluted and messy and hard for someone else to understand what you are trying to do.

It makes your code smaller, modular, cleaner, easy to read and most importantly reuse the codes in order to reproduce a certain type of result or analysis.

There are two types of functions, one you write on your own and other that are built in python and which you have already used.

for example:

print()
len()

No difference, only that you donâ€™t have to write them yourself.
