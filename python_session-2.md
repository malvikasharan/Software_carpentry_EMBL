##Python session - 2

##Aim of this session: 

Control flow: automating repeated boring tasks using loops rather than actively commanding Python to do stuffs (print, add etc.)

Control-flow allows Python to take a decision and do different things depending on different situations using if/else or for loops

###if/else loop

The if statement is used to check a condition, it looks for answer in true or false
- if the condition is true, block of codes inside the if statement will be executed

###For loop
```
shopping = ['bread', 'potatoes', 'eggs', 'flour', 'rubber duck', 'pizza', 'milk']
for item in shopping:
  print(item)
```
